## 🌐 Deploying to cPanel

This website is ready to be deployed to a cPanel hosting server. See the [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) guide for detailed instructions.

**Quick Start:**
1. Upload all files to your `public_html` directory
2. Make sure the `.htaccess` file is uploaded (this is critical!)
3. Visit your domain

The `.htaccess` file included in this repository configures your server to:
- Serve `index.html` as the default homepage
- Display the custom `404.html` page for missing pages
- Enable compression and caching for better performance

🧹 Just Exploring?
No problem! If you were just checking things out and don’t need to keep this code:

- Simply delete your Spark.
- Everything will be cleaned up — no traces left behind.
